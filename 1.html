<h1>Toys</h1>
<p>I don't get out much so I need javascript and CSS animations to brighten my day. This is a page where I will store some toys I found. Maybe I will come back to these later. Maybe not.</p>
<p>Side note... is it just me, or did Wordpress security issues and forced updates ruin my desire to code PHP?</p>
<p>Speaking of brightening my day... nothing brightens my day quite like player pianos and flickering candles. If I could make a whole haunted website with various instruments to click to start/stop, that would be a true delight.</p>
<p>These are code snippets below from CODEPEN, or as I like to call it, CODEPEN15. That's not a coupon code for 15 percent off. That's just a reference to the "PEN 15" club other kids at elementary school tricked me into joining. It turns out writing the club name on your hand is only fun for the other kids.</p>
<p>I was a loser.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are PEN 15s from the official CODEPEN15 club website</p> 
  <h2>Flickering candle</h2>

<p>I think it would be fun to dangle some animated caricature of a person above that candle, like Hitler or something really offensive. When I read this again, I probably won't think that is funny at all but it's 2:30 in the morning anything can happen.</p>

<h2>Player Piano</h2>
