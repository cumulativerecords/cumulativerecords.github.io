<h1>Toys</h1>
<p>I don't get out much so I need javascript and CSS animations to brighten my day. This is a page where I will store some toys I found. Maybe I will come back to these later. Maybe not.</p>
<p>Side note... is it just me, or does Wordpress make people hate PHP?</p>
<p>Speaking of brightening my day... nothing brightens my day quite like player pianos and flickering candles. If I could make a whole haunted website with various instruments to click to start/stop, that would be a true delight.</p>
<p>These are code snippets below from CODEPEN, or as I like to call it, CODEPEN15. That's not a coupon code for 15 percent off. That's just a reference to the "PEN 15" club I got invited to join in elementary school. Joining was easy. All I had to do was write the club name on my hand and show the other kids.</p>
<p>I was a loser.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are PEN 15s from the official CODEPEN15 club website</p> 
  <h2>Flickering candle</h2>

<p>I think it would be fun to dangle some animated caricature of a person above that candle, like Satan or something really offensive. When I read this again, I probably won't think that is funny at all but it's 2:30 in the morning anything can happen.</p>

<h2>Player Piano</h2>

  <h2>Court Skills</h2>
  <p>This guy is so good. I have been watching for two hours and he hasn't missed one yet.</p>

  <h2>Wow</h2>
  <p>If I have this for free then why did I spend $6000 on keyboards? Damn it.</p>
